              Our dynamic duo, Flori and Bram, first crossed paths at <strong>DeGiro B.V.</strong> (Europe's biggest
              broker) where they spent 8+ years debugging the mysteries of high-frequency trading systems and arguing
              over whether tabs or spaces make better code. Their friendship was forged in the fires of production
              incidents and late-night deployments.
            </p>
            <p>
              After conquering the brokerage world, they leveled up together at{" "}
              <strong>Amsterdam Platform Creation B.V.</strong> (private equity), where they discovered that managing
              money is just like managing code - both require careful version control and the occasional rollback when
              things go sideways.
            </p>

              Enter Volodymyr, the frontend wizard who joined their party at APC for 3+ years. Together, this trio
              formed the ultimate tech guild: Flori (the backend architect who speaks fluent C++), Bram (the data
              whisperer who can make Excel files confess their secrets), and Volodymyr (the UI/UX sorcerer who makes
              pixels dance).
